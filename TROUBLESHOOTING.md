# Portfolio Loading Issues - Troubleshooting Guide

## Issue

Sometimes only the Hero section loads, and other sections don't appear.

## What I Fixed

### 1. **Added Error Boundaries**

- Created `ErrorBoundary` component to catch React errors
- Wrapped the entire app and lazy-loaded sections with error boundaries
- Now you'll see error messages if something fails instead of a blank page

### 2. **Improved Loading States**

- Added a visible loading spinner with "Loading content..." message
- Reduced initial loading time from 2000ms to 1500ms
- Made the Suspense fallback more informative

### 3. **Removed "use client" Directives**

- Removed Next.js-specific directives from:
  - `aspect-ratio.tsx`
  - `lazy-image.tsx`
- These were unnecessary in a Vite/React app

### 4. **Added Debug Logging**

- Added console logs to track component mounting
- You can open browser DevTools (F12) to see:
  - "App rendering, isLoading: true/false"
  - "Loading complete - all sections should now be visible"
  - "Blogs section mounted successfully"

## How to Debug Further

### Open Browser Console (F12) and check for:

1. **Errors in Red** - These indicate JavaScript errors
2. **Console logs** - Should see:

   ```
   App rendering, isLoading: true
   App rendering, isLoading: false
   Loading complete - all sections should now be visible
   Blogs section mounted successfully
   ```

3. **Network Tab** - Check if any resources fail to load

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### Issue: Only Hero section shows

**Solution**: Check console for errors. Likely a component is failing to load.

#### Issue: Loading screen never disappears

**Solution**: Check if there are JavaScript errors preventing the app from rendering.

#### Issue: Blank page or error message

**Solution**: Click the "Reload Page" button that appears, or refresh browser.

#### Issue: Images not loading in blog section

**Solution**:

- Check internet connection (images load from picsum.photos)
- Check if ad-blockers are blocking external images
- Fallback images should appear if primary images fail

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Open browser DevTools Console (F12)
- [ ] Clear cache and refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
- [ ] Check for any red error messages
- [ ] Scroll down to verify all sections load:
  - Hero
  - About
  - Skills
  - Projects
  - Blogs (new section!)
  - Services
  - Certifications
  - Education
  - Testimonials
  - Contact
  - Footer

## New Blog Section Features

The new blog section includes:

- ✅ 12 pre-populated blog posts
- ✅ Lazy-loaded images for performance
- ✅ Hover effects on cards
- ✅ Responsive grid layout
- ✅ Beautiful background gradients
- ✅ Fallback images if loading fails

## If Problems Persist

1. **Clear browser cache completely**
2. **Try in incognito/private mode**
3. **Try a different browser**
4. **Check if it happens on first load or every load**
5. **Share the console errors** for further debugging

## Remove Debug Logs (Optional)

Once everything works, you can remove the console.log statements from:

- `src/App.tsx` (line 50)
- `src/hooks/useLoading.ts` (line 10)
- `src/components/Blogs.tsx` (line 6)
